        <ul>
          <li>I am always working to become more like Jesus in thought and deed.</li>
          <li>I manage some communities on Reddit and Discord.</li>
          <li>I enjoy beautiful things, like the outdoors and viewing artwork.</li>
          <li>I enjoy learning new skills and getting better at existing ones. Currently, I'm interested in learning more about Linux, programming, troubleshooting, and problem solving.</li>
        </ul>

          Since a young age, I have been interested in computers and how they work. This has helped me become familiar with Windows, Linux, and MacOS ecosystems as well as basic helpdesk/troubleshooting techniques.

          In some of my free time, I help as a global system operator at Wikipedia. This involves performing maintenance tasks various Wikipedia projects and occasional spam cleanup. At the time of writing, I also lead a few Reddit communities with a total of 23 million members and a Discord server with 17 thousand members!
          I've been able to automate some routine moderation tasks by writing filters and bots. It's also taught me a lot about customer service and conflict resolution! I'm open to doing freelance community management work!

          Occasionally, I'll play games like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or Minecraft. I'm not a competitive or experienced gamer by any means, but it's fun to sit back and enjoy a gaming session with friends sometimes!

          I'm a firm believer in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/touch_grass">touching grass</a> and highly recommend it. Get outside and do things! ðŸ˜€ Oh, and if you haven't received Jesus Christ's <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/">free gift of salvation</a>, you should look into that!
